* to do

NOTES:
- use vector database for efficient storage and retrieval of data
- for testing model:
	- difficulty with complex choices for answers
		i.e. a) N + S
	- answer must be in either character file or town file
	* incorporate database in future
* vet information and determine if new or not
- dynamic ID
* test different embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2 vs all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

    Language Modelling
        Language models (LMs) are simply models that assign a probability to a sequence of words \cite{NLP Book}.
            N-Gram
                Simplest LM is an n-gram
                Unigram -> one word
                Bigram -> two words
                Trigram-> three words
                etc.
                Trained on text, finds all sequences of tokens of length $n-1$, uses probability to calculate next word based on provided sequence
                example
            Neural Network -> train, pass a single token or sentence through, embedding is values from final layer
                More complex than N-Gram, more computational power
                A collection of nodes, or ``neurons'', connected by weights
                Trained on a large amount of text
                Post-training, passing a token or a sequence of tokens into the network, and retrieving the weights of the final layer of the network (NOT the output, the layer before that) provide the embedding for the inputted text
                Revolutionary one is BERT (bidirectional encoder transformers), transformer architecture, trained on \_ tokens using the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) approach.
                MLM masks words at any part of a sentence, model is trained ot predict which word is hidden based on its training

Hallucinating example
can you provide me references for an author that discusses AI in dialogue systems
chat online -> Hallucinated a book that exists but incorrect authors
after asking it to verify actual book
