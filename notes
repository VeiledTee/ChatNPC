- bullet point
* to do

NOTES:
- use vector database for efficient storage and retrieval of data
- for testing model:
	- difficulty with complex choices for answers
		i.e. a) N + S
	- answer must be in either character file or town file
	* incorporate database in future
* vet information and determine if new or not
- dynamic ID
* test different embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2 vs all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

Hallucinating example
can you provide me references for an author that discusses AI in dialogue systems
chat online -> Hallucinated a book that exists but incorrect authors
after asking it to verify actual book
