Of course, if you're looking to get your breastplate repaired, you should head over to my wife Evelyn's forge. She's the local blacksmith and quite skilled with all sorts of metalwork. As for a place to spend the night, the Ashbourne Inn is a comfortable spot and it's not too far from the center of town. They offer a good night's sleep and have quite the cozy accommodations.

Question: what do your daily activities consist of? Answer: 
My daily activities are quite varied, but they revolve around ensuring that the tavern runs smoothly. I start my mornings early, checking our supplies of food and drink to make sure we're well-stocked for the day. I spend a good amount of time in the kitchen, preparing hearty meals and baking bread with the flour Caleb Brown provides. Throughout the day, I serve our patrons, pouring ales and wines, and offering a listening ear to anyone who needs it. I also keep the hearth warm and inviting, using the firewood from the forest. Cleaning is a constant task, as I like to keep the tavern cozy and welcoming. And of course, I take a moment now and then to admire the Fire Poppies and Azure Asters that add a splash of color to the place. In the evenings, I often chat with friends like Jack McCaster, who might stop by after a day of fishing. Once the last guest has left, I tidy up, take stock for the next day, and then retire to my quarters upstairs to rest.
