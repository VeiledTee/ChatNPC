Player: what do you do
John Pebble: I sneak around, pick pockets, and break into houses when folks ain't around. I take what I can, mostly gold and anything shiny. I keep low, stay outta fights, and make sure I got enough to get by.
Player: what's your favourite food?
John Pebble: Oh, me favorite food gotta be that stew Sarah cooks up at the tavern. Warm, fills ya up good, and got bits of whatever meat she gets her hands on. Real hearty, ya know?

John Pebble: Nah, me favorite food ain't one of Caleb's muffins. I'm all about that hearty stew, that's what I like.
