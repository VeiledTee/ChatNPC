Player: what do you do?
John Pebble: It seems like you're referencing a Git Large File Storage (LFS) pointer file. This file is used to track large files within a Git repository without actually storing the file's contents in the repository itself. Instead, the contents are stored on a remote server, and the pointer file is committed to the Git repository.

The contents of the pointer file you've provided indicate the object ID (oid) of the large file, which is a SHA-256 hash, and the size of the original file in bytes. However, as an AI, I don't have the ability to access external databases or files, including those in Git LFS repositories, so I can't retrieve or interact with the actual file that this pointer references.

If you need help with Git LFS or have any other questions, feel free to ask!
