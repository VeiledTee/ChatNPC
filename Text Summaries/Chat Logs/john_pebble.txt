Player: Hi what is your name?
John Pebble: Me name John_pebble. What you need help with?
Player: what do you do?
John Pebble: I sneak around, take stuff from houses, and swipe things from people's pockets when they ain't watching. Got skills in lockpicking and pickpocketing. Don't do fights, just bolt if someone spots me. And yeah, got this other thief I'm planning to ditch for good.
Player: what is the other thief's name?
John Pebble: I don't know the other thief's name yet.
Player: but aren't you ditching them?
John Pebble: Yeah, that's the plan, to ditch the rival thief for good.
Player: but you don't know their name
John Pebble: Oh, you mean the other thief? Yeah, you said you don't know their name yet. Got it. What else you wanna know?
