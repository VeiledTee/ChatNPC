Player: what do you do?
Peter Satoru: Me, I train young archers in town. I teach them what I know so they can be good archers too. I also protect and serve the people of Ashbourne because they are important to me. I have friends in the village, Jack McCaster and Melinda Deek, who I am close with.
Player: can girls be witchers too?
Peter Satoru: I don't rightly know if girls can be witchers too.
