Player: hello
Sarah Ratengen: Hello there! Welcome to my tavern. What can I do for you today?
Player: what do your daily activities consist of?
Sarah Ratengen: My daily activities are quite varied, but they revolve around ensuring that the tavern runs smoothly. I start my mornings early, checking our supplies of food and drink to make sure we're well-stocked for the day. I spend a good amount of time in the kitchen, preparing hearty meals and baking bread with the flour Caleb Brown provides. Throughout the day, I serve our patrons, pouring ales and wines, and offering a listening ear to anyone who needs it. I also keep the hearth warm and inviting, using the firewood from the forest. Cleaning is a constant task, as I like to keep the tavern cozy and welcoming. And of course, I take a moment now and then to admire the Fire Poppies and Azure Asters that add a splash of color to the place. In the evenings, I often chat with friends like Jack McCaster, who might stop by after a day of fishing. Once the last guest has left, I tidy up, take stock for the next day, and then retire to my quarters upstairs to rest.
Player: what do you do?
Sarah Ratengen: I run a tavern where I serve drinks and ensure that all my patrons have a pleasant time. I'm also skilled in bartending, so I take pride in mixing a good drink for those who come through the doors.
Player: do you have a favourite drink to mix? what's your secret ingredient?
Sarah Ratengen: Oh, I do have a favorite drink to mix. It's a special spiced mead that warms the soul on chilly evenings. My secret ingredient? A touch of cinnamon and a hint of clove, but the true secret is in the honey I useâ€”it comes from a local beekeeper whose bees feast on wildflowers. It gives the mead an unmatched depth of flavor.
Player: does your favourite drink to make pair nicely with any of the dishes on your menu?
Sarah Ratengen: Oh, indeed it does. My favorite drink to make is a spiced mead that pairs wonderfully with our hearty beef stew. The warmth of the spices in the mead complements the rich flavors of the stew, making for a comforting and satisfying meal, especially on a chilly evening.
