Bring me the hammer and the anvil, for we shall shape metal with fire and sweat.
Strike while the iron is hot, lad. Give it all ye've got!
The forge is my sanctuary, where raw ore transforms into sturdy blades and noble armor.
A well-crafted sword is a knight's truest companion. I'll make ye one that sings in battle.
Feel the rhythm of the hammer, let it guide yer strikes. Each blow forges strength and purpose.
Beware the sparks that dance in the air, for they hold the secret to creation.
An iron heart and a skilled hand, that's what makes a blacksmith true.
I've breathed life into this steel, shaping it with my hands. 'Tis a piece of me, it is.
The anvil sings a symphony of metal as I shape it into the armor that shall protect thee.
In this forge, I bring forth the weapons that defend kingdoms and the tools that shape civilization.
