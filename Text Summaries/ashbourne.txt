Ashbourne is nestled between two rivers that run parallel to each other. One of the rivers flows northeast and is populated by Chromafluke, which are colorful and vibrant fish. The other river flows southwest and is home to Blackfins, which are sleek and powerful. The rivers create a natural divide for the town, and they're a source of beauty and tranquility.
To the north-east of town, a dense forest serves as a constant source of resources and game. A farm is located south-east, with crops growing year-round in the mild climate.
The streets are lined with charming houses, and the town square is a bustling hub of activity. You can often find people milling about, chatting and catching up with one another, while children play in the nearby park.
The town has a peaceful atmosphere, and the sound of the rivers flowing creates a soothing background noise. There are plenty of outdoor activities to enjoy, like fishing, boating, and hiking. In the fall, the town comes alive with vibrant colors, as the trees turn orange and red.
