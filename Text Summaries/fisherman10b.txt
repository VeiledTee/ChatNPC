Tis not treason to speak the truth.
Ach, be careful there! I've been diggin' some holes fer ice fishin', and I'd not want ta have ta fish ye out! There's a rare fish here that I've got me eye on, but the blighter keeps snappin' me line!
Oh, I don't begrudge th' good king some of my fine catch. Lets me drive up the prices even higher with the local lordlings - ha!
Of course, of course. Shame ye have ta be travelin' all this ways, though. The King must be inta fish a lot these days. Seems I gave him a good haul just a fortnight ago!
Ah, well, that's mighty kind of 'im indeed. Why just the other day I was just sayi-- Huh. Did ye hear that noise, just now?
I... I heard tales of some beastie, but I thought it twas just on accountin' of a feller being too deep in his cups. Now though, I'm not being so sure...
Is now really the time fer letterin'?! Didja hear that, it sounds like it be gettin' closer!
Run, man, run fer yer lifes!
Well... you'll have to make it quite worth it for me.
Well just a few gold more per fish if you want it this early!
